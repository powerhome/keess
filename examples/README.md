# Keess example files

This folder contain example files to demonstrate / experiment / test Kess. You can try them with the local clusters brought up by `make setup-local-clusters`.

If you intend to change and commit these files, **BEWARE** that many of these files are
used by our e2e tests, so you might break them. The files used for those tests should be
prefixed with "test-" just to make that intent more clear.
