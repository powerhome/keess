	Short: "Synchronize secrets and configmaps across namespaces and clusters.",
	// Long: `Keess (Keep Stuff Synchronized) is a command-line tool designed to operate within Kubernetes clusters, focusing on the synchronization of secrets and configmaps. It efficiently handles the transfer of these critical components across different namespaces within a single cluster, as well as across multiple clusters, ensuring consistency and security in distributed environments.

	// Key Features:
	// - Cross-Namespace Synchronization: Sync secrets and configmaps across various namespaces in a single cluster.
	// - Inter-Cluster Synchronization: Extend synchronization capabilities to multiple Kubernetes clusters.
	// - Security-Oriented: Ensures secure transfer, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
	// - Automation and Efficiency: Automates synchronization processes, reducing manual effort and error.
	// - Customizable Rules: Offers flexibility in defining specific synchronization conditions.
	// - User-Friendly CLI: Easy-to-use command-line interface for seamless integration and operation.
	// - Logging and Monitoring: Provides comprehensive logs for tracking and auditing purposes.

	// Keess streamlines Kubernetes configuration management, making it an essential tool for DevOps teams and Kubernetes administrators seeking to maintain uniformity and security across their infrastructure.`,
